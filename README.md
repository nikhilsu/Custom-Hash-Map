# Custom-Hash-Map
Implementing a custom hash map in Java. The main features of this Hash map are as follows:-

1. The Hash map implementation is Thread-safe!
2. It has a custom iterator which iterates over the Key-Value pair in a **Thread-safe** manner!
3. Hash collisions are handled by using a Double-Linked-List.
